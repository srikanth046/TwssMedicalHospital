                            Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at the
                            cellular and molecular level. It emerged as a distinct discipline around the beginning of
                            the 20th century when scientists combined chemistry, physiology,
                            and biology to investigate the chemistry of living systems.
