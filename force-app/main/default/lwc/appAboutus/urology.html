        <p>Urology is a branch of medicine that focuses on medical conditions of the male and female urinary tract
            systems. The urologist is a medical professional that specializes in the urinary system. In ancient times,
            doctors used to examine the urine of a patient for clues about their illness. Today, there is an entire
            field of medicine that focuses on the health of the urinary system which includes the kidney, bladder,
            prostate, penis & testis. Below mentioned FAQs broadly describe the urology problems and mention the
            alarming signals of seeing the urologist</p>

         <p>  <b>Is The Urinary Tract? </b> <br>
            The kidneys, ureters, and bladder, are the key components of the urinary tract. The urinary tract is your
            body’s drainage system for removing urine. Urine is a combination of wastes and water. In order for
            urination to occur normally and without any complications, all body parts in the urinary tract need to work
            together.</p> 

            <p> <b>What Do Urologists Do?</b> <br>
            A urologist is trained to diagnose and treat problems of the urinary tract. Urologists deal with men and
            women alike. With women, a urologist deals only with the problems of the urinary tract. With men, however,
            the urologist can diagnose and treat disorders of the penis and testicles also. They also look after male
            infertility and sexual disorders.</p>

           <p> <b>When Should I See The Urologist?</b> <br>
            Your doctor may advise you to visit a urologist if you’re exhibiting symptoms of a Urinary Tract Infection
            (UTI), difficulty in passing urine, blood in urine, Incontinence (urinary leakage), or Erectile Dysfunction.
            As these illnesses lie in the scope of a urologist, a general doctor will recommend that you visit one. The
            urologist also looks after male infertility and sexual problem.</p>

           <p> <b>What Can I Expect?</b> <br>
            The urologist will normally perform a range of tests to determine what the problem is. Imaging tests, such
            as an ultrasound, CT, MRI scan, can help the urologist to locate the problem and a urine test may be
            performed to check for bacteria and other signs of disease. If the situation is more serious, a biopsy may
            be performed; this is traditionally to check for cancer and other disorders. The urologist may also ask you
            questions about your medical history and carry out a physical examination.

            If you’re experiencing a frequent need to urinate pain in passing urine, difficulty in passing urine, blood
            in urine, pain in your lower back, or trouble sustaining an erection and early ejaculation. You should
            consult an expert. In order to maintain a healthy urinary tract, urologists recommend that you regularly
            empty your bladder and drink water instead of caffeine. They also stress the importance of avoiding smoking
            and maintaining a low-salt diet. By following these simple rules you can prevent a wide range of urological
            problems. All tumors or cancer of the kidney, urinary bladder, prostate, penis, and testis are also treated
            by the urologist. Moreover, Most urologists also do kidney transplants. </p>
